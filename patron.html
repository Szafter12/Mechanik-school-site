                <h6>Choosing a Patron is one of the most important decisions in the life of a school. In a time of moral
                    crisis and the degradation of many values, we have jointly decided that the unquestionable authority
                    for us - teachers, pupils and school staff - can only be the person of John Paul II. When Karol
                    Wojtyla became Pope in 1978, no one imagined that this would be one of the most important
                    pontificates in the history of the Church. Based on the truths proclaimed by the Holy Father, we
                    want to shape the youth of our school. On 14 October 2003, we celebrated the 80th anniversary
                    combined with naming the School after John Paul II. All the time we continue our didactic and
                    educational work, bringing us closer to the figure and the teachings of the Holy Father. The School
                    Feast (16.XI) has been permanently inscribed in the calendar of school events and celebrations.

                the Holy Father travelled a total of 1162615 km. During 148 beatifications, he proclaimed 1,343 blesseds
                and 51 canonisations under his leadership gave the Church 482 saints. The Holy Father held 1161

                these years. The Vatican hosted 38 official visits by heads of state. At 9 consistories, John Paul II
                elevated 232 priests to the dignity of cardinal (the highest number in the history of the Church). His
                pontificate has produced an enormous number of documents, including 14 encyclicals, 15 apostolic
                exhortations, 11 apostolic constitutions, 45 apostolic letters and thousands of papal letters.
